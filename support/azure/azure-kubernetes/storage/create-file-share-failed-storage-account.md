# Failed to create file share on storage account

This article discusses how to troubleshoot why you can't create a file share on a storage account that's used for dynamic provisioning on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Symptoms

PVC status stuck in Pending when AKS creates a file share.
You receive the following error when `kubectl describe pvc`:

> persistentvolume-controller (combined from similar events):
>
> Failed to provision volume with StorageClass "azurefile":
>
> failed to create share kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-xxx in account xxx:
>
> failed to create file share, err:
>
> storage: service returned error: StatusCode=403, ErrorCode=AuthorizationFailure,
>
> ErrorMessage=This request is not authorized to perform this operation.

## Cause

The Kubernetes `persistentvolume-controller` isn't on the network that was chosen when the **Allow access from** network setting was enabled for **Selected networks** on the storage account.
Expecially, when user specifies `useDataPlaneAPI: "true"` on storage class, the persistentvolume-controller use data plane API for file share create/delete/resize, while it would fail when there is firewall or vnet setting on storage account.

## Workaround

Creating a file share with dynamic provisioning would fail, so create a file share and set up your AKS cluster to use [static provisioning with Azure Files](/azure/aks/azure-files-volume).
